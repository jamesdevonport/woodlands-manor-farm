          Woodlands Manor Farm is a 17th-century working farm set at the top of the Coombe Valley,
          two miles from the North Cornwall coast. Andy and Ruth Peters moved from London in 2019
          — swapping software companies for a life of sunshine, animals and making sure guests
          have the best holiday they&rsquo;ve ever had. Seven cottages, two luxury Mongolian yurts,
          a heated indoor pool and two miles of coastline on the doorstep.

            We moved from London in September 2019, swapping a life running software companies for
            a life in sunny Bude and tourism. We love the change, and our goal is to ensure you
            have the best holiday possible with family and friends — making happy memories that
            last a lifetime.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are always available by phone or email and genuinely love hearing from guests. The
            farm, the animals, the pool — it is all here because we believe you deserve a holiday
            where you never have to worry about a single thing.
