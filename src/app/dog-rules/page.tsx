            Dogs are very welcome at Woodlands Manor Farm in every one of our cottages and yurts
            — there&rsquo;s no extra charge. We have farm animals, woodland walks and miles of
            dog-friendly Cornish coastline. Below is what we ask in return.

                Many guests bring dogs that have never been around livestock. The first time
                seeing alpacas, sheep or pigs can be exciting — please:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>Always keep your dog on a lead near the animal paddocks.</li>
                <li>Don&rsquo;t allow your dog to bark at, chase or stress the animals.</li>
                <li>Take care around chickens — they wander freely in the courtyard.</li>
                <li>If your dog has a strong prey drive, give the animal areas a wide berth.</li>
              </ul>
              <div className={s.warn}>
                ⚠ Worrying livestock is a criminal offence. The farmer is legally entitled to
                shoot any dog caught attacking sheep — please don&rsquo;t put us in that
                position.

                a short walk takes you to footpaths along the Coombe Valley and onto the South
